    <br>
    <b1 style="color:White; font-family:Courier New;"> For my fifth project we analyzed data. The PLTW assignment had us interpreting data from a space rover. Data was given in a very compressed format and had to be both visualized and sorted. Using the data we deciphered, we found that the rover was located on a desert plain. This conclusion came about due to the constant loud sounds and varying regularity of winds that were only from desert plains. </b1>
